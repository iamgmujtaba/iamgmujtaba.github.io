I bring a rich blend of academic and industrial experience to the computer vision and deep learning domain. Holding a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Gachon University](https://www.gachon.ac.kr/sites/eng/), I focused on personalized multimedia generation for resource-constrained devices at the Multimedia Computing Systems Laboratory (MCSLab) under the guidance of [Prof. Eun-Seok Ryu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zWkXcPIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My academic background includes a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Indus University](https://www.indus.edu.pk/) and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [COMSATS Institute of Information Technology](https://lahore.comsats.edu.pk/default.aspx) in Pakistan. As a specialized computer vision researcher, I excel in utilizing deep learning techniques for visual analysis, multimedia retrieval, and image processing. I am dedicated to advancing computer vision and deep learning in both academic and industrial settings.
